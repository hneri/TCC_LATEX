 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
The project management is crucial because it allows the manager to monitor the progress of the project in points of interest of the organization, the customer and the people involved. Between software metricsâ€™ that are categorized in product, process and project, the projects one are explored so that you can keep the project on track in terms of cost, time and scope. The comparison between the traditional and Agile management methods, SCRUM and PMBOK, respectively, it is necessary to study the techniques of Earned Value Management in traditional projects and Agile Earned Value Management in Agile projects. The application of the Tradicional Earned Value technique in Agile projects faces on assumptions that go against the values espoused by the Agile Manifesto. Thus, using the AgileEVM technique for Agile software development projects, it is possible to monitor the performance and progress of the project by monitoring costs. With these data, it is possible to use a Data Warehouse environment to automate the process of extraction, transformation, loading (ETL) and visualization of costs derived from the production of software.
